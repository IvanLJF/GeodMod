mex -setup    (I think, try mex file.f -n to see whether your compiler is in the path)

mex  disloc3d.f dc3d.f

#############################################
disloc3d doen not compile properly under linux

The test program

test_disloc3d           (which does twice the same thing) should produce:

ns =
     []
ans =
     []
ans =
     []
ans =
     []
ans =
   1.0e+04 *
    2.2202    2.2202

as it does it under solaris
