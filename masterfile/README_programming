Oct 4 2006: Many function are setting for required input currently 
defaultopt=struct(                                                         ...
        'demfile'            ,        'off'                   ,            ...
        'ShadedRelieffile'   ,        'off'                   ,            ...
This is confusing because these fields need to be filled for the function to work.
We should think about something like
defaultopt=struct(                                                         ...
        'demfile'            ,        'required'
This may entail the modification of process_defaultoptions.m
